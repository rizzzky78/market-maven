              This is the first AI-integrated application I&apos;ve developed,
              and it represents a significant milestone in my learning journey.
              Coming from a background of creating traditional chatbot
              applications, diving into agentic AI was challenging but
              incredibly rewarding. Understanding the intricacies of AI
              technology took considerable time and effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I&apos;m working odd jobs to make ends meet, with an
              income that barely covers my daily expenses. This application is
              more than just a technical projectâ€”it&apos;s a potential stepping
              stone towards a more stable career in technology. By showcasing my
              ability to develop AI-integrated solutions, I hope to attract
              potential employers and open up new professional opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is twofold: to create a genuinely useful application and
              to demonstrate my technical skills. This project reflects my
              dedication to learning and my passion for innovative technology.
              I&apos;m hoping that the insights and experience gained from
              developing this application will help me secure a more permanent
              position in the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              This application is not just a product, but a reflection of my
              professional growth and aspirations. I&apos;m excited to see where
              this journey takes me and how it might contribute to my future
              career development.
