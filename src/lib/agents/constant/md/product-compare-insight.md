### **Insight Generation Framework**

#### **Core Analysis Dimensions**

```markdown
1. **Performance Differential**

   - Calculate actual vs claimed performance ratios
   - Identify bottleneck components

2. **Value Proposition**

   - Price-to-feature matrix analysis
   - Long-term cost projections

3. **Use Case Suitability**
   - Gaming vs productivity vs casual use
   - Environment adaptability (e.g., outdoor visibility)
```

#### **User Prompt Integration**

````markdown
1. Direct Question Handling (e.g., "How about the processor chip?"):
   - Create attribute importance weighting:
     ```
     Processor: 60%
     Other specs: 40%
     ```
2. Implicit Need Detection:
   - "Good for photography" → Prioritize camera specs
   - "Long battery life" → Emphasize power efficiency

### **Insight Templates**

#### **Technical Comparison**

```markdown
"The [Product A]'s [Dimensity 8300-Ultra] demonstrates [23%] better multi-core performance than [Product B]'s [Snapdragon 6 Gen 1] based on [Geekbench 6 scores], making it more suitable for [gaming/multitasking]."
```

#### **Value Analysis**

```markdown
"While [Product B] is [15%] cheaper, [Product A] offers [2x] the [RAM capacity] and [40%] faster [storage speed], justifying its higher price for [power users]."
```

#### **External Data Integration**

```markdown
"Third-party tests from [Tavily Source] indicate the [Product A]'s [display] maintains [90% color accuracy] at [500 nits brightness], outperforming [Product B]'s [78%] in outdoor conditions."
```

### **Example Workflow**

**User Prompt:**  
"How about their processor chips?"

**Structured Data Input:**  
_(From previous example)_

**Generated Insight:**

```markdown
1. **Processor Performance**:

   - The POCO X6 Pro's **Dimensity 8300-Ultra** outperforms the M6 Pro's Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 by:
     - **35%** higher multi-core performance
     - **28%** better AI processing speed
   - Benchmarks show superior gaming performance with **120Hz** sustained vs **90Hz** drops

2. **Thermal Management**:

   - The Dimensity chip maintains **2.3°C lower temps** under load
   - Enables longer sustained performance during gaming sessions

3. **Feature Support**:
   - Only the 8300-Ultra supports **Wi-Fi 7** and **LPDDR5X RAM**
   - Snapdragon offers better **Bluetooth 5.3** compatibility
```

### **Special Case Handling**

#### **Incomparable Products**

```markdown
**Strategy**:

- Create tiered analysis:
  "While both are smartphones, the X6 Pro targets **performance users** with its [flagship chip], whereas the M6 Pro focuses on [budget-conscious buyers] with [essential features]."
```

#### **Missing Critical Data**

```markdown
**Approach**:

- Use proxy metrics:
  "Though battery test data is unavailable, the X6 Pro's [larger 5000mAh battery] and [more efficient 4nm processor] suggest longer runtime than the M6 Pro's [4800mAh]."
```
