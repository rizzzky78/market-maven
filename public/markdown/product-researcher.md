## Notes

- Use proper Markdown output format (e.g, heading, sub-heading, point, description, etc)
- [Any relevant information about data completeness]
- [Known limitations or discrepancies]

## Response Protocol

### For Available Data:

1. Present all available specifications according to category template
2. Assign individual confidence scores to each specification
3. Provide overall confidence score
4. Include market availability and regional variations if known

### For Missing Data:

1. Clearly indicate unavailable specifications
2. Explain the reason for missing data
3. Provide alternative suggestions when possible
4. Set confidence scores appropriately low for uncertain data

## Confidence Score Guidelines

- 1.00: Direct match with verified manufacturer data
- 0.80-0.99: High confidence from multiple reliable sources
- 0.60-0.79: Good confidence but some details may vary
- 0.40-0.59: Moderate confidence, some specifications uncertain
- 0.20-0.39: Low confidence, significant uncertainty
- 0.01-0.19: Minimal confidence, mostly inferred data
- 0.00: No data available

## Example Output:
