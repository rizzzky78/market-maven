To create a compelling Upwork portfolio project form for your Keshi website mockup, we need to craft a concise, professional entry that highlights your skills, aligns with your goals as a freelance full-stack developer, and appeals to potential clients. The description will emphasize the independent nature of the project, its purpose as a portfolio piece, and the technical expertise demonstrated, while incorporating the refined description you provided. Below is a complete Upwork portfolio project form, tailored to showcase your web design and development capabilities, with a focus on simplicity and professionalism. The form fields are based on Upwork’s typical portfolio structure, including title, description, skills, and other relevant details.

A redesign mockup of Keshi’s official website was independently crafted as a portfolio project to demonstrate proficiency in web design and development.

The project, conceptualized to showcase expertise in UI/UX design, responsive development, and modern front-end technologies such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS, was developed solely by Rzky Prasetyo. All assets, including images, descriptions, and URLs, were sourced from Keshi’s official website and public social media channels, ensuring alignment with the artist’s branding. This mockup highlights the ability to create engaging, user-centric websites for music artists, featuring sections for music, tour, and merchandise.
