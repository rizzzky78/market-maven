Inspired by the baton Tommie used in four record-breaking races, 7,872 digitally-rendered baton NFTs will bring Tommie’s salute and message of unity and perseverance to digital space. In partnership with 24 organizations fighting for human rights—Tommie’s Legacy Team—the project will use blockchain technology to drive meaningful change.\n\n(01)\n\nptb\\_teaser\\_music from Flow on Vimeo\n\n![video thumbnail](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1853111053-8f22edb588ef4483e70ea948bbab1826cad5f0a0222a3ce907afcab0c2003155-d?mw=80&q=85)\n\nPlaying in picture-in-picture\n\nPlay\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/a2274902e2-1715827306/ptb_videocover_02-1920x1080-crop-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/12da4cc6b7-1715826083/ptb_instagram_featured_jesse_02-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/063de068a7-1715828607/ig_jesse_baton_01b-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/310fca3d96-1715828671/igpost_singlebaton_megan_03b-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n#### The Cause\n\nPass the Baton proudly supports 24 non-profit organizations that continue the fight for equality. Civil rights is an intergenerational struggle, and this project creates vital ongoing support for those that carry the baton for future generations.\n\nProceeds from the sale will also enable the artist to support the acquisition of the monumental sculpture Invisible Man (Salute) by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the large-scale installation Bridge by the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\n\n(02)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/370937aa31-1715827005/og_ptb_01-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/a840b2b168-1715827027/rfxptb_01-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n#### The Website\n\nPass The Baton raised funds by selling unique evolving NFTs on their website. These NFTs increased in value as they were passed from person to person, attracting donors interested in both supporting the cause and potential investment. Through transparent communication and community engagement, they built trust and iterated on their concept, ultimately achieving success in fundraising for their cause.\n\n(03)\n\nptb\\_website\\_scroll\\_01 from Flow on Vimeo\n\n![video thumbnail](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1853117148-261fb2b160aedd82d7590e44a1efbedff913e89d38164f4e9c0a0cc89b110f43-d?mw=80&q=85)\n\nPlaying in picture-in-picture\n\nPause\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/1f65b1b562-1715828396/ptb_videocover_03-1920x1080-crop-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/pass-the-baton/f0445b75ed-1715828963/ptb_profile_pic_02-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n#### Next case\n\n#### (04)\n\n### 5\n\n# Opplio App\n\n### 2024\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/opplio-app/43aefc875e-1715705165/opplio_illustration_01-1920x1080-crop-q72.jpg)",
