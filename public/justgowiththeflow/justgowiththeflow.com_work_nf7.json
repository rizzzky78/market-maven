This robot excels both as a player and a coach, with unmatched physical abilities and advanced AI algorithms. It plays alongside human athletes, offering lightning-fast decision-making and precision, while also coaching them with personalized feedback and strategies based on real-time analysis.\n\nThe animation showcases the seamless integration of technology and athletics, suggesting a future where human-robot collaboration redefines sports performance and coaching.\n\n(01)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/3b6d3e0120-1715705182/nf7_cover-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/36a82392d5-1715705183/nf7_img_01-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/88794aeeda-1715705184/nf7_img_02-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/3768db24e7-1715705183/nf7_img_03-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/b7ba318745-1715983230/nf7_img_07-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n#### The Film\n\nThe NF7 project seamlessly merges live-action filming with computer-generated graphics, beginning with meticulous pre-production planning to envision a futuristic world. Actual actors are filmed in real-world settings, while motion capture technology captures their movements for the creation of highly realistic CG robot models. These CG elements are seamlessly integrated into the live-action footage during post-production, with additional visual effects added to enhance the futuristic ambiance. Sound design further immerses the audience, incorporating effects that bring the world of futuristic robot football players/trainers to life.\n\nThis comprehensive approach results in a visually stunning portrayal that makes the concept easy to envision and engage with.\n\n(02)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/e8449046c2-1715724796/nf7_img_04-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/99b5ad35bc-1715724957/nf7_img_05-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/nf7/fd52ef557c-1715725006/nf7_img_06-1920x-q72.jpg)\n\n#### The Online Experience\n\nThe NF7 project extends its reach with an online platform enabling users to craft their personalized NF7 robots. Through an intuitive interface, users select from a variety of customization options, including body design, colors, and features. These designs are seamlessly integrated into the NF7 universe, allowing users to see their creations in promotional materials or even the film itself.\n\n(03)\n\n#### Next case\n\n#### (04)\n\n### 1\n\n# Samsung\n\n### 2023\n\n![](https://justgowiththeflow.com/media/pages/work/samsung/d5d29cd9fc-1715705137/samsung_screenshot_02-1920x1080-crop-q72.jpg)",
