This guide provides you with the best practices and strategies to get the most out of Maven, your AI-powered product assistant. Whether you're searching for a specific item, comparing options, or seeking recommendations, these \"recipes\" will help you achieve optimal results. Learn how to craft effective queries, leverage Maven's tools, and interpret the insights provided.\n\n## Understanding Maven's Core Concepts\n\n### The Orchestrator\n\nMaven's orchestrator is the central intelligence that drives the entire process. It's responsible for understanding your input, selecting the appropriate tools, and managing the flow of information. Think of it as a highly skilled research assistant that knows exactly how to find and process the information you need. The orchestrator uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to interpret your requests, even if they are complex or ambiguous.\n\n### Agent Tools\n\nMaven utilizes specialized tools to gather and process information, each designed for specific tasks.\n\n#### Recommendator\n\nProvides personalized product recommendations based on your needs and preferences.\n\n#### Search Product\n\nQuickly finds specific products based on their names (full or partial).\n\n#### Get Product Details\n\nGathers comprehensive information about a specific product.\n\n#### Products Comparison\n\nAllows you to directly compare two products side-by-side.\n\n#### Inquire User\n\nAsks clarifying questions to ensure Maven fully understands your needs.\n\n### AI-Powered Insights\n\nMaven goes beyond simply presenting data; it provides AI-powered insights to help you understand the why behind the results. These insights are generated using natural language generation and explain the reasoning behind recommendations, highlight key features of products, and summarize comparisons. They are designed to be concise, informative, and easy to understand.\n\n### Streamed Results\n\nMaven delivers results progressively as they become available, thanks to its streamed result architecture. This means you see information appear on the screen in real-time, rather than waiting for a long processing period. This provides a more interactive and responsive experience, allowing you to start evaluating results immediately.\n\n## Recipes\n\nBasicAdvancedExpert\n\nPersonalized RecommendationsFinding a Specific ProductDetailed Product Information\n\nPersonalized Recommendations\n\nLearn how to use Maven to discover products tailored to your specific needs and preferences.\n\n#### Ingredients\n\n- A general idea of what you're looking for (e.g., \"headphones,\" \"gaming laptop\").\n- (Optional) Specific requirements or preferences (e.g., \"noise-canceling,\" \"under $1000,\" \"lightweight,\" \"good battery life\").\n\n#### Steps\n\n##### 1. Start with a broad query\n\nBegin by entering a general description of the product you're interested in.\n\nUser Input: \"I need new headphones.\"\n\n##### 2. Provide context (essential for best results)\n\nAdd as much detail as possible about your needs, preferences, and intended use. The more context you provide, the better Maven can understand your intent and generate relevant recommendations.\n\n- Use Case: Where and how will you use the product?\n- Budget: What's your price range?\n- Key Features: Are there any specific features that are important to you?\n- Brand Preferences: Do you have any preferred brands?\n- Style Preferences: Do you have any preferences regarding style or design?\n\nUser Input: \"I need new headphones for working from home. Noise-canceling is essential, and my budget is around $300. I prefer over-ear headphones.\"\n\nUser Input: \"Looking for a gaming laptop under $1500. It needs to have a good graphics card and at least 16GB of RAM.\"\n\n##### 3. Review the recommendations\n\nMaven's Recommendator tool will analyze your input and generate a list of personalized product suggestions. Pay attention to the order of the recommendations; they are typically ranked by relevance.\n\n##### 4. Explore the insights\n\nCarefully read the AI-powered insights provided with each recommendation. These insights explain why a particular product was suggested, highlighting its key features and how they align with your needs. This is crucial for understanding the recommendations and making an informed decision.\n\n##### 5. Refine your query (iterative process)\n\nIf the initial recommendations aren't quite right, don't hesitate to refine your query.\n\n- Add more details: Provide additional context or specifications.\n- Adjust your criteria: Change your budget, feature requirements, or brand preferences.\n- Use different keywords: Try using synonyms or alternative phrasing.\n- Correct Misunderstandings: If Maven seems to have misinterpreted your intent, clarify your request.\n\n##### 6. Utilize related queries\n\nIf the related query feature is enabled, explore the suggested related searches to discover alternative products or refine your search further.\n\n##### 7. Attach Product\n\nIf you have a product in mind, you can attach it to get a recommendation based on it.\n\n#### Expected Outcome\n\nYou'll receive a list of product recommendations that are highly relevant to your input, along with detailed explanations to help you understand the suggestions and make an informed choice.\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\n##### I'm not getting any recommendations.\n\nMake sure you've entered a valid query. Try starting with a broader query and then adding more details. Ensure your query is not too niche or specific.\n\n##### The recommendations are irrelevant.\n\nDouble-check that you've provided enough context. Refine your query with more specific details about your needs and preferences.\n\n##### I'm seeing too many recommendations.\n\nNarrow down your search by adding more constraints, such as a stricter budget or more specific feature requirements.\n\n## General Tips and Tricks\n\nBe Specific: The more specific your queries and requests, the better Maven can understand your needs and provide relevant results. Use precise language and avoid ambiguity.\n\nProvide Comprehensive Context: Include all relevant details, such as your budget, intended use, desired features, brand preferences, and any other constraints.\n\nUse Full Product Names (When Possible): When searching for a specific product, use the full and accurate product name for the best results.\n\nLeverage AI-Powered Insights: Always read the insights provided by Maven. They explain the reasoning behind recommendations, highlight key features, and summarize comparisons, helping you make informed decisions.\n\nIterate and Refine: Don't be afraid to refine your queries or requests based on the initial results. Product research is often an iterative process.\n\nMaster the Inquiry System: Actively participate in Maven's inquiries by providing clear and concise answers. This is crucial for personalization.\n\nExplore Related Queries: Use the related queries feature to discover alternative products and broaden your search.\n\nCombine Tools Strategically: For complex research tasks, learn how to combine multiple Maven tools to achieve your goals.\n\nUnderstand Limitations: While Maven is powerful, it relies on available online data. Information may be incomplete, outdated, or unavailable for certain products.\n\nDouble-Check Information: Always verify critical information (especially pricing and availability) on the retailer's website before making a purchase.\n\nProvide Feedback (If Possible): If your application has a feedback mechanism, use it to report any issues or suggest improvements. This helps the developers improve Maven over time.\n\nStart Broad, Then Narrow: If you're unsure where to begin, start with a broad query and gradually add more details to narrow down the results.\n\nUse Natural Language: Maven is designed to understand natural language, so you don't need to use special keywords or commands. Just ask your questions as you would to a human research assistant.\n\nExperiment: The best way to learn how to use Maven effectively is to experiment with different queries, requests, and tools.\n\n## Become a Maven Master!\n\nBy following the guide and best practices outlined in this cookbook, you can unlock the full potential of Maven and transform your product research experience.
